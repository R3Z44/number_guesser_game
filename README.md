# Number Guesser Game Project

## Description
This project is a game where the system chooses a random number and the player must guess the number. After each guess, the program shows a hint to the player that the number is greater than or lower than the number while the player finally guesses the correct number. Then the program shows a congratulations message to the player and the game ends. Whenever the player wants to leave the game, he/she will type "q" and then the game ends with a Goodbye message!
